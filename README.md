Intention: 
This google app script will 
1. connect to online accounting Xero via OAuth 
2. extract invoices from Xero Demo organization
3. transform and save those invoices into google spreadsheet.

NOTES: 
You need to sign up xero and create a public application. Add the consumerKey and consumerSecret to app script user properties.
For now, you need to create a spreadsheet and add the spreadSheetId to app script user properties too.
